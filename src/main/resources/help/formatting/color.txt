NetworkChat supports every color from Raw Json Text.
For example - <blue>\<blue></blue>\</blue> and <#ffbfbf>\<#ffbfbf></#ffbfbf>\</#ffbfbf>.

However, you can also use fancier color formatting more easily than with raw json text:
<rainbow>\<rainbow></rainbow>\</rainbow>
Gradients are supported in theory, but are broken at this time.
